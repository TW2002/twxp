<FONT><B>Usage:</B><BR><BR><PRE>Run this script from a deep space sector.  You will need at least a holo-scanner on your ship,
although it is strongly recommended that you also have a transwarp drive.

It is strongly recommended that you have at least 50 cargo holds if you are TWarp colonising.
This is because of the cargo holds needed to hold the fuel to TWarp you.

If you are low on cash when starting the script, it will automatically trade it up for you
using the World Trade algorithm.

For planet building to be successful, terra needs to have a decent number of colonists.  If
it runs out, you'll find the script just scouting around searching for them.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Warnings:</B><BR><BR><PRE>Keep your ship strongly defended at all times.  The busting of planets and general wear-and-tear
from scouting will add up damage very quickly.

The frequency with which this script visits fedspace, the excessive E-Warping and scouting
algorithms will make this script easy to hunt by even the greenest player.  Be very careful
about running it in hostile games unless you are a super-power.

Never, never, ever, run this script in a low turn game.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Notes:</B><BR><BR><PRE>This script uses subroutines shared by the following other pack2 scripts:

- World Trade
- Mass Colonise
- Mass Upgrade
- Gather
- Buydown

.. in addition to a planet busting/creation subroutine.

Because of the massively broad scope of this script and the variance of modern game settings,
this script is not extremely reliable; it instead exists as more of a demonstration of what
can be done using the pack2 subroutines.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR><HR>
<A NAME="SCRIPT_5"><H3>Colonisation</H3><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Purpose:</B> Colonises a planet in a large variety of ways.</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>File name:</B> 2_Col.ts</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Trigger point:</B> Planet command prompt of planet to colonise</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Features:</B><BR><BR><PRE>- Fast and turn efficient support for E-Warp, T-Warp and TPad colonising
- Able to extract fuel from any source in the target planet's sector
- Automatic calculation of fuel needs
- Reliable E-Warp algorithm won't be hung up easily
- Adjustable turn limit will prevent script from running turns too far down
- Adjustable cycle limit to control the number of colonists to gather
- Calculation of target planet colonists to prevent planet from being overloaded
- Easy to use configuration menu
- Resistant to interference from in-game messages
- Safety features to prevent accidental B-Warp</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Usage:</B><BR><BR><PRE>Run this script from the surface of the planet you are trying to colonise.  Make sure your
alignment is 1000 or above, and that you control at least one fighter in the sector you are
colonising.

You will need some source of fuel if you are trying to T-Warp or TPad colonise.  This fuel
can come from either another planet in the sector or a port (Sxx).

Your cargo holds will need to be empty when you start this script.  Also make sure you have
some cash onhand if you are colonising using a fuel port.

Your ship requires either a Type1 or Type2 transwarp drive to perform T-Warp or T-Pad colonising.
If you are using T-Pad colonising, the planet with the transporter pad must have also have
a range high enough to reach terra.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Warnings:</B><BR><BR><PRE>All avoids set in the path between the sector you are colonising and terra MUST be kept clear.
This is important because the script calculates its fuel needs through calculations made in
the ship's computer.  If your avoids are not clear you may find that the script is taking
more fuel ore than it should.

E-Warp colonising is very easy to track and can be extremely dangerous.  Do not attempt this
in hostile games.

If your player experience is 1000 or above, it is very easy for other players to take shots
at you while you colonise.  The script will provide no protection against this - try to make
sure your ship is heavily armed.

Experienced players may try to track your planet's location through calculations based on
your colonist pickup.  If you are concerned about this, try carrying 2-6 holds of organics
or equipment while you colonise.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Notes:</B><BR><BR><PRE>T-Pad colonising is marginally more turn efficient than T-Warp colonising.  It is also faster,
since the TWGS standard ship delay does not apply to it.  Unfortunately it uses fully 10 units
of fuel ore per transwarp hop, where T-Warp colonising uses only 3.

Naturally, having a planet closer to terra makes for far more efficient colonising.  In the
later stages of a game it is often a good idea to move any L4+ planets to within 5 hops of
terra and use T-Pad colonising to maximise your efficiency.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR><HR>
<A NAME="SCRIPT_13"><H3>Evil</H3><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Purpose:</B> Performs SDT, SST or RTR between a near limitless number of ships.</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>File name:</B> 2_Evil.ts</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Trigger point:</B> Sector command prompt</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Features:</B><BR><BR><PRE>- Fast and configurable SDT, SST and RTR
- Works with a near limitless number of ships
- Fully configurable and port-independant haggle support
- Able to broadcast bust information on sub-space radio
- Cumulative steal quantity based from player experience for maximum profit
- Cumulative rob amount based from player experience
- Easy to use configuration menu
- Resistant to interference from in-game messages
- Fast product sales when haggling is not required
- Automatic and intelligent port upgrades
- Automatic and efficient sell-offs and port/planet onhand equipment tracking</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Usage:</B><BR><BR><PRE>Run this script from the command prompt in any one of the ships you are working from.  This
script will make its first steal from the ship you start it in, then continue through the
list of ships in order from first to last.

Sectors for which you are performing SDT MUST have a source of equipment - either on the port
you are stealing from or on the first planet in that sector.  Ships used for SDT must have
empty holds.

Sectors for which you are performing SST must have either equipment in their holds, or they
must be empty.  The SST subroutine will automatically upgrade work ports as necessary.

Sectors you are performing RTR in must have credits onhand to rob.  If an RTR port runs out
of credits, the port will be treated as though the ship busted in it (it will be removed from
the work list so that the script can continue).

The formula that calculates how many credits the RTR subroutine will rob is experience * rob
factor.

You will need to be in control of any fighters in the sectors you are working - if enemy fighters
are placed, the script will hang.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Warnings:</B><BR><BR><PRE>Make sure all ships are within transport range of eachother.

Do not run this script at ports you have active busts at - this will fake bust you.

Make sure you have your steal and rob factors set correctly.  Setting them too high will cause
you to bust far more than you otherwise should.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Notes:</B><BR><BR><PRE>RTR (Rob-Transport-Rob) is an old-fashioned but effective way of making money as an evil player.
Unfortunately, it is very dependant on your experience.  The 4 turn cycle is as follows:

1. Rob credits from port A
2. Transport to ship B
3. Rob credits from port B
4. Transport to ship A

Typically, it is unsafe to steal more than your experience multiplied by 3.  However, different
games may have different rob settings.

For more information on the SDT and SST routines, see 2_SST and 2_SDT.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR><HR>
<A NAME="SCRIPT_6"><H3>Find</H3><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Purpose:</B> Navigates the game in search of a particular sector.</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>File name:</B> 2_Find.ts</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Trigger point:</B> Sector command prompt</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Features:</B><BR><BR><PRE>- Can be used to find bases, ports, or just about anything
- Intelligent and configurable movement algorithm able to avoid hazards
- Very configurable search sector
- Able to resume if disconnected from the server (when used with login script)
- Resistant to interference from in-game messages
- Easy to use configuration menu</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Usage:</B><BR><BR><PRE>Simply load this script from the sector command prompt, it will continue to wander the game
until it finds a sector with attributes that match those you specify.  When the sector is
found, the script will send a certain string of text to the game before terminating.  You
could easily set this up to TWarp you back to safety in the event you are looking for an enemy
base.

Your ship requires at minimal a holoscanner to run this script.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Warnings:</B><BR><BR><PRE>This script is designed for high or unlimited turn games.  Although the movement algorithm
is relatively efficient, it is far from perfect.  Scouting manually is usually far preferable
in low turn games.

When set to reckless, this script will enter any sector in its path.  You should avoid this
setting unless you are certain the universe you are playing in is safe.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Notes:</B><BR><BR><PRE>This script can be a big time saver.  Recommended uses are:

- Finding a good site to build a base
- Finding an enemy base
- Finding a class 0 or class 9 port
- Finding a certain trader that was towed from fedspace
- Finding alien homeworlds
- Improving your sector map or % explored
- Dropping figs or mines around the game (just set the search sector to something that can't
be found)</PRE></FONT><BR><BR><HR>
<A NAME="SCRIPT_14"><H3>Gather</H3><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Purpose:</B> Seeks out and gathers a one type of product onto a planet.</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>File name:</B> 2_Gather.ts</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Trigger point:</B> Target planet command prompt</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Features:</B><BR><BR><PRE>- Automatic seeking and gathering of required product
- Works within one sector, or can go out searching
- Fast and efficient gathering of products
- Super-fast product movement when shifting products around one sector
- Full optional haggling support
- Intelligent and configurable movement algorithm able to avoid hazards
- Can be adjusted to drop fighters, mines, or just about anything
- Easy to use configuration menu
- Resistant to interference from in-game messages</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Usage:</B><BR><BR><PRE>Run this script from the command prompt of the planet you want to gather products onto.  The
script will then search the entire sector for a source, moving the required product around
if it is found.

Your cargo holds must be empty when you run this script.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Warnings:</B><BR><BR><PRE>Make sure you own all planets within range of the script - as it will be unable to invade
them.

The 'Seek' option is not recommended for low turn games.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Notes:</B><BR><BR><PRE>This script is a great way to fuel up planets rapidly.  However, 2_MassUpgrade is definitely
an easier way to perform citadel upgrades.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR><HR>
<A NAME="SCRIPT_15"><H3>Mass Colonise</H3><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Purpose:</B> Colonises every planet in a sector.</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>File name:</B> 2_MassColonise</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Trigger point:</B> Sector command prompt</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Features:</B><BR><BR><PRE>- Automatic colonisation of every planet in a sector
- Automatic colonise fuel source searching
- Calculation of best category to deposit colonists
- Run-time colonising calculation used to prevent planets from being overloaded
- Support for E-Warp colonising
- Resistant to interference from in-game messages
- Safeguards to prevent accidental blind-warp</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Usage:</B><BR><BR><PRE>Run this script from the command prompt of a sector you want filled with colonists.  The script
will continue to colonise until all the planets are full, terra is out of colonists, or no
more fuel is available (if E-Warp colonising is disabled).</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Warnings:</B><BR><BR><PRE>Do not run this script in a low turn game.

All avoids set in the path between the sector you are colonising and terra MUST be kept clear.
This is important because the script calculates its fuel needs through calculations made in
the ship's computer.  If your avoids are not clear you may find that the script is taking
more fuel ore than it should.

E-Warp colonising is very easy to track and can be extremely dangerous.  Do not attempt this
in hostile games.

If your player experience is 1000 or above, it is very easy for other players to take shots
at you while you colonise.  The script will provide no protection against this - try to make

Experienced players may try to track your planet's location through calculations based on
your colonist pickup.  If you are concerned about this, try carrying 2-6 holds of organics
or equipment while you colonise.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Notes:</B><BR><BR><PRE>When used in combination with 2_MassUpgrade, this script gives an easy way to automate the
uglier areas of unlimited turn play.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR><HR>
<A NAME="SCRIPT_16"><H3>Mass Upgrade</H3><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Purpose:</B> Upgrades the citadel of every planet in a sector.</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>File name:</B> 2_MassUpgrade</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Trigger point:</B> Sector command prompt</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Features:</B><BR><BR><PRE>- Completely automatic upgrading of every planet in a single sector
- Can be set to ignore certain planets
- Automatic seeking and gathering of required products and colonists
- Works within one sector, or can go out searching
- Fast and efficient gathering of products
- Super-fast product movement when shifting products around one sector
- Full optional haggling support
- Intelligent and configurable movement algorithm able to avoid hazards
- Can be adjusted to drop fighters, mines, or just about anything
- Easy to use configuration menu
- Resistant to interference from in-game messages</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Usage:</B><BR><BR><PRE>Run this script in a sector full of planets that you want upgraded.  A source of colonists
is required either in this sector or on a planet nearby (if "Seek products" is enabled).


Your cargo holds must be empty.  If "Seek products" is enabled, your ship also requires a
holo-scanner.

You will need some credits onhand if the script buys products from a port.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Warnings:</B><BR><BR><PRE>Ensure you own all planets in the sector.

Use of this script in a low turn game is not advised if "Seek products" is enabled.

If "Seek products" is disabled, make sure you have the required products in the sector to
upgrade all the planets.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Notes:</B><BR><BR><PRE>This script is very powerful when used in combination with 2_MassColonise.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR><HR>
<A NAME="SCRIPT_8"><H3>Ping</H3><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Purpose:</B> 'Pings' fellow players when performing the SSF/SDF red cashing routines.</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>File name:</B> 2_Ping.ts</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Trigger point:</B> Sector command prompt</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Features:</B><BR><BR><PRE>- Automatic 'pinging' of players, compatible with almost all SSF and SDF routines
- Safety option to prevent attacking players with less than or equal to 5 fighters
- Faster option to get the job done quicker
- Fully automated calculation of attack text - all you need is a player name
- Easy to use configuration menu
- Self terminating option when bust text is noticed (from 2_SSF/2_SDF scripts)</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Usage:</B><BR><BR><PRE>This script is designed to be used by SDF/SSF support players that need to continually attack
(or "ping") a player between sectors.

Run this script from the same sector as the player you are about to start "pinging".  The
script will automatically calculate the text it has to send in order to "ping" the target
player.  You should configure this script to trigger off the exact text the SDF/SSF player
is spitting out on the radio when they are requesting a "ping" from you.  The script will
continue to "ping" the player until they report a bust (unless you terminate it).</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Warnings:</B><BR><BR><PRE>This script performs NO tracking of fighters on the target's ship unless the "Safe" option
is enabled.  This means it is possible to destroy the target by accident.  Note that the 2_SSF/2_SDF
scripts have their own safety mechanism which should prevent this, although many other SDF/SSF
scripts don't.  You might want to keep a close eye on the target's fighter count.

"Pinging" a red player can give significant alignment increases over time.  Make sure your
corp structure is suited to this before you start heavy use of SSF/SDF.

Make sure you have sufficient fighters to cause the target player to flee from the sector.
Your ship must have 25% more fighters than the target has fighters+shield.

Be careful to terminate the script on completion of the red's SSF/SDF run.  If you leave it
running, you risk it triggering off and shooting things at a bad time.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Notes:</B><BR><BR><PRE>This script works best with the two SSF/SDF script pack2 routines in TWX Proxy.  However,
it should be compatible with just about any SSF/SDF script out there as long as you set the
trigger text properly.

For more information on SDF or SSF routines, have a look at the documentation for 2_SDF and
2_SSF.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR><HR>
<A NAME="SCRIPT_12"><H3>Port Buy Down</H3><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Purpose:</B> Buys products down from a port.</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>File name:</B> 2_BuyDown</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Trigger point:</B> Sector command prompt</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Features:</B><BR><BR><PRE>- Fast and configurable buydown routine
- Configurable haggling for both best and worst price
- Super-fast burst buydown without displays when haggling is disabled
- Works with both a turn and quantity limit
- Will not buy down past maximum amount on port
</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Usage:</B><BR><BR><PRE>Run this script from the planet you want to buy down to.  Make sure no enemy fighters are
in your sector, otherwise the script will be unable to get information on the port.

Make sure your cargo holds are empty when you start this script, and that you have sufficient
credits for the buydown.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Warnings:</B><BR><BR><PRE>Do not attempt a buydown on a port that has been destroyed or that you have an active bust
with.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Notes:</B><BR><BR><PRE>This is a standard buydown script.  Possible reasons for wanting to buy down a port could
be:

- Preparation for a megarob
- Upgrading planets
- Building up fuel supplies on planets
- Planet trading</PRE></FONT><BR><BR><HR>
<A NAME="SCRIPT_17"><H3>Probe</H3><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Purpose:</B> Sends ether-probes out from the stardock.</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>File name:</B> 2_Probe</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Trigger point:</B> Sector command prompt at stardock</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Features:</B><BR><BR><PRE>- Automatic and configurable probe routine
- Credit limit prevents script from using too many credits
- Turn limit to control script turn usage
- Support for classic "avoid" probing
- Support for definition of "search" sector, script stops after this sector is found
- Can work from a probe list or just every sector in the game
- Able to output probe results to text files
- Easy to use configuration menu
- Resistant to interference from in-game messages</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Usage:</B><BR><BR><PRE>Run this script from the sector prompt in the stardock sector.  You will need a decent amount
of credits onhand which the script will use to buy probes.  Note that the script will make
use of any probes onhand before buying more.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Warnings:</B><BR><BR><PRE>If you are not safe from attack in fedspace, be VERY careful about running this script - as
you will be an easy target for your enemies.

Be wary of other players trying to surround the stardock with their fighters as soon as they
spot you probing.  Trying to probe from a surrounded sector will give very poor results; its
often wiser to wait until the other players are away from the keyboard, offline, or asleep.

Avoid running this script from any sector except for the stardock.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Notes:</B><BR><BR><PRE>Probing early in a game is an excellent way of improving your chances of finding areas of
importance.  Simple things such as finding class 0 ports, checking deadends and finding towed
players become much easier with a good probe script.

This script is powerful when used in combination with 2_Query, as you can use the output from
2_Query as a probe list.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR><HR>
<A NAME="SCRIPT_7"><H3>Query</H3><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Purpose:</B> Performs an advanced and configurable query on the TWX Proxy Database.</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>File name:</B> 2_Query.ts</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Trigger point:</B> Sector command prompt</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Features:</B><BR><BR><PRE>- Very configurable database query routine
- Option to output to a text file
- Can be run from anywhere
- Easy to use configuration menu</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Usage:</B><BR><BR><PRE>This script is designed to provide a list of sectors that match a certain criteria.  It is
an excellent way of retrieving information from the TWX Proxy database.  Simply run this script
from anywhere (even while offline), and enter in your sector criteria using the configuration
menu.

This script also has the option to output the sector list to a text file; from here the information
could easily be run through another script, sent to the printer, etc.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Warnings:</B><BR><BR><PRE>Be careful to keep your query criteria specific.  A broad list of 20,000 sectors can take
quite a long time to display.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Notes:</B><BR><BR><PRE>This script could be considered a much more flexible version of the queries built into the
TWX Proxy "Data" menu.  It can be used for just about anything from finding good base sites
to that special sector you saw 3 days ago and forgot about.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR><HR>
<A NAME="SCRIPT_2"><H3>SDF</H3><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Purpose:</B> Performs the difficult and time consuming Steal-Dump-Flee red cashing method between two sectors.</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>File name:</B> 2_SDF.ts</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Trigger point:</B> Sector command prompt</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Features:</B><BR><BR><PRE>- Fast and functional SDF between two sectors
- Fully configurable and port-independant haggle support
- Adjustable turn limiter; deactivates script when turns reach a certain point
- Configurable planet usage
- Automatic and efficient sell-offs and port/planet onhand equipment tracking
- Automatic bust and profit calculations can be broadcasted on sub-space radio
- Cumulative steal quantity based from player experience for maximum profit
- Easy to use configuration menu
- Resistant to interference from in-game messages
- Adjustable triggering for any kind of SDF/SSF pinger script
- Tracking of fighters/shielding to prevent accidental death or podding</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Usage:</B><BR><BR><PRE>Run this script in a standard sector set out for SDF.  As per standard SDF sequence, you'll
need at least 3 people to perform this routine.  Get your corpmates to surround both adjacent
working sectors with fighters that do not belong to you - this will make sure your ship will
always be 'pinged' into the correct sector.

Each sector must have a source of equipment - either on the planet or onhand on the xxB port.
The more equipment is available, the less turns are required per SDT cycle (so profit is higher).

This script uses two haggle factors, one for each port.  Ideally you should try to set your
haggle factors as high as you can, although ports will start to reject prices more frequently
with higher settings.  The optimal setting is usually from 3 to 7.

Note that SDF makes its profit in large blocks - this means it is quite possible for the script
to make absolutely no visible profit if it busts early.  The profit/turn ratio should only
be taken as an accurate value if the script sells off more than 5 times before being busted.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Warnings:</B><BR><BR><PRE>This script will make its first steal in the sector it is run from.  Make sure this port isn't
the last port you stole from.  Also, do not run this script if you have an active bust in
either working sector.

Make sure your ship is well equipped with figs and/or shield before you start this script.
The script should automatically terminate if your defences fall too low, although its always
better to play it safe.  Accidents tend to happen very easily during SDF.

Your ship's cargo holds must be empty when you start this script.

Always keep personal fighters in the sectors you are working.  Personal fighters will not
block the 'fleeing' of your ship, but WILL make it more difficult for other players to hunt
you.  Many people make the mistake of leaving their work sectors empty of fighters, and pay
the ultimate price for this when a rival team finds their work area because of this.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Notes:</B><BR><BR><PRE>SDF is an extremely efficient money maker, unfortunately because of its complexity most players
are easily intimidated by it.  Also, the routine takes a very long time to perform and is
relatively unsafe.  Do not attempt to perform this routine without a veteran player to guide
you.

The sequence for SDF is as follows (3 turn cycle):

1. Steal equipment from port A (1.5 turns)
2. Drop the equipment on a planet
3. Request a 'ping' from a teammate to move you to the other sector
4. Steal equipment from port B (1.5 turns)
5. Drop the equipment on a planet
6. Request a 'ping' from another teammate to move you back to the first sector

Every time your ship is 'pinged' out of the sector by another player, there is a 50% chance
that you will lose an extra turn on approaching the port in your new sector.  Therefore this
is in theory a 3 turn cycle, but technically it can range from 2-4 turns.

In theory it is possible to make approximately 27M in one day in a 1000 turn game through
this routine.  Although in practice profit usually ranges from 13-20M depending on bust rates
and port prices.

This script automates the basic sequence of SDF (including stealing and planet sell-offs).
You will need to set up the area yourself.  "Pinging" players should use an SSF/SDF assistance
script such as 2_Ping.ts</PRE></FONT><BR><BR><HR>
<A NAME="SCRIPT_1"><H3>SDT</H3><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Purpose:</B> Performs the popular Steal-Dump-Transport red cashing method between two ships.</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>File name:</B> 2_SDT.ts</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Trigger point:</B> Sector command prompt</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Features:</B><BR><BR><PRE>- Fast and functional SDT between two ships/ports
- Fully configurable and port-independant haggle support
- Adjustable turn limiter; deactivates script when turns reach a certain point
- Configurable planet usage
- Automatic and efficient sell-offs and port/planet onhand equipment tracking
- Automatic bust and profit calculations can be broadcasted on sub-space radio
- Cumulative steal quantity based from player experience for maximum profit
- Easy to use configuration menu
- Resistant to interference from in-game messages</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Usage:</B><BR><BR><PRE>This script must be run from the sector command prompt, from inside one of the two ships to
be used for SDT.  Both ships must be within transport range of each other, in orbit of xxB
ports and there must be an easily accessible planet in both sectors.
Each sector must have a source of equipment - either on the planet or onhand on the xxB port.
The more equipment is available, the less turns are required per SDT cycle (so profit is higher).

This script uses two haggle factors, one for each port.  Ideally you should try to set your
haggle factors as high as you can, although ports will start to reject prices more frequently
with higher settings.  The optimal setting is usually from 3 to 7.

Note that SDT makes its profit in large blocks - this means it is quite possible for the script
to make absolutely no visible profit if it busts early.  The profit/turn ratio should only
be taken as an accurate value if the script sells off more than 5 times before being busted.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Warnings:</B><BR><BR><PRE>This script will make its first steal from the ship the player is in - make sure this isn't
the last port that you stole from.  Also make sure that the second ship you are SDTing with
is well within transport range.

Do not run this script at ports you have active busts at - this will fake bust you.

Make sure you control the fighters underneath the ports you are working at.  If they are owned
by another player, the script may hang unexpectedly while trying to get port details.  However,
be careful not to leave the ports without fighters underneath them - as this will make you
a target for any player trying to hunt you.

It is strongly recommended that the cargo holds of both ships are empty when you start this
script.

Beware of setting the haggle factors too high - this will cause the ports to reject offers
and cost you valuable turns.

Make sure you have your steal factor set correctly.  Setting it too high will cause you to
bust far more than you otherwise should.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Notes:</B><BR><BR><PRE>SDT is a very efficient way of making profit as a red player.  The 6 turn cycle is as follows
(from sector in ship A):

1. Steal equipment from port A (1 turn)
2. Drop the equipment on a planet
3. Transport to ship B (1 turn)
4. Steal equipment from port B
5. Drop the equipment on a planet
6. Transport to ship A (1 turn)

The sequence is an improvement over SST, as you do not need to take the extra turn to sell
equipment back to the port quite as often.  Instead, the equipment is sold back to the port
in big chunks from the planet.  Because of this, your profit margin is decided largely by
how heavily the ports are upgraded (or how much equipment is available in the sector).

In theory it is possible to make up to about 13M credits by SDTing in a 1000 turn game.  However,
profit is usually limited heavily by turns needed to stop and refurb lost holds - also, good
ports can be hard to find and defend.  A more typical daily profit would range from 7-10M
with blue support players.

This script almost completely automates the entire SDT sequence - all you need to do is set
up the ports and planets.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR><HR>

<FONT><B>File name:</B> 2_Sentinel.ts</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Trigger point:</B> Anywhere global functions are supported</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Features:</B><BR><BR><PRE>- Turnless monitoring and reporting of CLV, CIM and User Online changes
- Can be run from anywhere
- Ability to broadcast changes on sub-space radio
- Ability to log changes to a file, showing their date and time
- Monitoring of a particular corp in the game, will notify if fighters belonging to this corp
are attacked (identified through alignment changes)
- "Inactivity mode" allows the script to run in the background, activating if an inactivity
warning is received</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Usage:</B><BR><BR><PRE>You can run this script from anywhere that has access to the global game commands.  Unfortunately,
to make use of CLV checks you will need to be either in a planet citadel or at the sector
command prompt.

Inactivity mode allows the script to run in the background while you play.  If an inactivity
warning is noticed, the script will automatically activate and start reporting changes.  If
you press a key, the script will return to its background status.

If the script is run while offline from the TWGS server, it will automatically enter inactivity
mode with the same settings as the last time it was used.  This means you can add the script
to your Auto Run list and have it running every time you are in the game.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Warnings:</B><BR><BR><PRE>Not all players enjoy having their teammates report every minor detail on sub-space.  If you
are working with a full corp, it is often a better idea to set the 'CLV Detail Level' option
to 'LOW'.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Notes:</B><BR><BR><PRE>This script can be used for CIM hunting.  Simply turn off the CLV and Online user checking,
and set the cycle time to something low (below 5000ms).  This should give you near real-time
reports on changes that occur within your explored area.

The information shown by this script should not be underestimated.  USO 2002 (United States
Open TW Tournament) gave an excellent example of how powerful CLV or highscore tracing can
be.  Almost every act of importance has some effect on a player's alignment or experience
- and almost all of these changes can be traced back to their cause.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR><HR>

- Automatic and intelligent port upgrades</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Usage:</B><BR><BR><PRE>Run this script in a standard sector set out for SSF.  As per standard SSF sequence, you'll
need at least 3 people to perform this routine.  Get your corpmates to surround both adjacent
working sectors with fighters that do not belong to you - this will make sure your ship will
always be 'pinged' into the correct sector.

If you have equipment in your cargo holds, the script will make use of this.  So long as your
holds are not full of another type of product, the script should function properly.

This script uses a haggling algorithm that attempts to lock on to the best sell price for
each port.  This means that although the haggling may seem to be extremely inefficient to
start with, it should improve as the routine continues its work.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Warnings:</B><BR><BR><PRE>This script will make its first steal from the ship you start it in.  Make sure this was not

<FONT><B>Notes:</B><BR><BR><PRE>SSF is not a very widely used routine.  SDT is, by comparison, far more efficient and less
complex.  However, there are still situations where this cashing method can become useful.
Use of this routine is not advised unless you are competent with red cashing methods or you
have another player to guide you.

The sequence for SSF is as follows (5 turn cycle):

1. Sell equipment to port A (1.5 turns)
2. Steal equipment from port A (1 turn)
3. Request a 'ping' from a teammate to move you to the other sector
4. Sell equipment to port B (1.5 turns)

that you will lose an extra turn on approaching the port in your new sector.  Therefore this
is in theory a 5 turn cycle, but technically it can range from 4-6 turns.

In theory it is possible to make approximately 16M in one 1000 turn day using this routine.
However, a more realistic figure usually is usually 10-14M if working with blue support players.

<FONT><B>Usage:</B><BR><BR><PRE>Simply load this script from the command prompt in a deep space sector.  Your ship must have
a holo-scanner to run this script.  You'll also need around 100k credits onhand to properly
kick-start the SSM process (depending upon how many holds you are stealing).

Disabling haggling will allow much better performance and a quicker income.  However, haggling
at ports will give slightly improved turn/profit efficiency.

Note that the refurb routine used by this script will work with both class 0 and class 9 (stardock)
ports.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Warnings:</B><BR><BR><PRE>Ensure you have your steal factor set correctly.  Setting it too low will SEVERELY impair
your profit.

Be very careful about running this script in a hostile universe.  The automatic fighter/shield
refurb option was added to allow the script to survive while you are away from the keyboard,
as it tends to travel randomly to just about every sector in the game.  If you are worried
about warping into a cannon or large group of fighters, it may be better to run WorldTrade
instead.

This script is extremely easy to hunt.  Enemy players will tend to lurk around refurb points
and try to ambush or limpet you.  Keep your ship well defended at all times.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT><B>Notes:</B><BR><BR><PRE>World SSM still stands as the fastest money-maker in most unlimited turn games to date.  Players
frequently use this script to attempt early takeovers of games.

This script has (in theory) a maximum profit of 576M credits per hour under optimal conditions.
However; busts, bad ports, refurb times and game edits reduce this by a massive amount.  Even
if the game settings are properly suitable for large scale SSM, this figure usually won't
top 150M per hour.

Players will often brag that they can break 1B per hour through SSM.  In later versions of
TWGS, this is technically impossible.  Every time a player warps between ports there is a
built-in delay of at least 250ms.  Therefore, even when working with ports that will provide
40k credits per equipment sale, and without ever busting once, it is impossible to top 576M per hour.</PRE></FONT><BR><BR><HR>
